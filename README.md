# Engineering Calculator

A calculator for all engineers.

## Initialization

To start developing the project we need to initialize a node package. Run:

    $ npm init --yes

## Cucumber

This project is developed using BDD approach. In order to have live and
maintainable behavior specification, we used Cucumber to document behaviors and
run them.

### Installation

The project is written using JavaScript. We need `node.js` and node's package
manager, `npm`, to run behavior specifications.

#### Node.js

Installing `node.js` and `npm` on _OS X_:

    $ brew install node

Print `node.js` and `npm` versions to verify successful installation:

    $ node -v
    $ npm -v
